<p> I started dancing Ballet when I was 3 after watching the movie "Barbie and The Twelve Dancing Princesses". Since then,I would dance to every song I hear. My parents decided to send me for ballet class. After 10 years, I'm still dancing ballet. </p>
<p> In December 2017, I decided to take up acrobatic gymnastics. I love acrobatic gymnatics as I get to learn the tricks that I've always wanted to do, e.g. handstands and cartwheels.</p>
<p> I hope that with the skills that I have learnt through my hobbies, I will be able to become a Principle Dancer in a famous ballet company. :)</p>
  <h2> Travelling</h2>
  <p> I also like to travel. Every year my family and I will go overseas. Last year, we went to Italy. During this Italy trip, I learnt a lot of new thing, I also got to eat alot a pasta, pizzas and other amazing food and desserts. I visited the Colosseum, Leaning Tower of Pisa and also the smallest city on earth, aldo known as the Vetican City. My family enjoyed ourselves and took many picyures to keep as memories. </p>

  <h3> K-Pop </h3>
  I aslo like to listen to Kpop. My favourite Kpop boy band is BTS, also known as Bangtan Soyeondan. My favourite Kpop girl group is Blackpink. I feel that Kpop gives me motivation.
